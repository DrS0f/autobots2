The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the iOS Instagram automation MVP into a production-ready application, completing two major phases. Phase 4 focused on robust features like persistent user interaction tracking, cross-session deduplication, advanced error handling, and per-account concurrency. Subsequently, Phase 5 introduced a comprehensive SaaS licensing and remote kill-switch system, including a dedicated FastAPI license server and client-side integration, alongside a 1-Click Docker-based deployment system. Both phases were fully implemented, rigorously tested, and approved for production.

The project then shifted to implementing per-device task queues and workflow cloning. The AI engineer completed and verified Phase 1-3 which involved building the backend schemas, APIs (mock), and frontend UI changes for this new system, all operating in a safe/mock mode to allow UI/API validation without live execution. The most recent task involved a significant UX polish of this Safe Mode demo, enhancing the user journey with onboarding, scenario simulation, and improved feedback. This work was ongoing, with new frontend components being created when the trajectory ended.

The application automates iOS Instagram interactions via a web dashboard, mimicking human behavior. Initially, it handled basic actions (liking, following). A key feature, the Engagement-Based Crawler, identifies users from posts to perform actions like following or liking, incorporating human delays and filtering. Phase 4 brought production readiness with persistent interaction logging, cross-session deduplication, advanced error handling (rate limits, account suspension), and strict per-account concurrency. Phase 5 implemented a full SaaS licensing model with a remote kill-switch, requiring a dedicated license server, client-side integration, and UI updates. A 1-Click Docker deployment system was also established. The current development goal is to implement per-device task queues and workflow cloning, aiming for device-siloed execution for increased safety, IP/fingerprint isolation, and fine-grained pacing/capacity controls per device. This involves new data models, APIs, and a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul, initially in a safe mock mode for validation. The latest requirement focuses on polishing the Safe Mode demo for a smoother, intuitive user journey and preparing for real device integration.

<pending_tasks>
The immediate pending task, as per the user's last explicit request in Chat Message 179, is to:
-   Enhance the existing Safe Mode demo system by refining the UI/UX for a smoother, more intuitive end-to-end user journey, ensuring it is ready for real device integration in Phase 4 without disrupting current mock functionality. This includes implementing:
    -   User Journey Mapping (Daily Workflow path).
    -   Persistent Status Visibility (Status Strip).
    -   Improved Action Feedback (toasts/snackbars).
    -   Queue Insights (Next Action ETA).
    -   Session Continuity (localStorage for unfinished creations).
    -   Scalability Prep (centralized mock data source configuration).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully completed the comprehensive implementation and rigorous testing of the Phase 5 SaaS Licensing & Kill-Switch system and the 1-Click Installer, declaring them production-ready.

Following this, the AI engineer completed and verified Phase 1-3 of the per-device task queues and workflow cloning system. This included:
1.  **Backend**: Creation of  and  collections, extension of tasks with , , and . New mock in-memory queues were added. New API endpoints for , ,  (requiring ), and  were implemented, all operating in a mock/read-only fashion with no live task execution.  is exposed via .
2.  **Frontend**: Integration of new UI components:  (global banner),  (template creation, deployment), and updates to  (queue visualization),  (device selection, queue position). The  was updated with a new Workflows tab. This entire phase was thoroughly tested on both backend and frontend, operating in Safe Mode with mock data, achieving 100% success rates.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on Phase 4 of the per-device task queues initiative, which is focused on polishing the UX of the Safe Mode demo. This involves making the application feel real and demo-ready by implementing guided onboarding, scenario simulation, and smoother user flows. The latest action involved creating several new frontend components: , , , , and . The next step in this ongoing work is to create the enhanced  component and integrate all new UX enhancements into the .
